#### Background-2

After being founded in 2002, aspose.com was the first website launched by Aspose Pty Ltd which started by offering components for .NET developers. At that time, aspose.com was just a .NET component publisher, building and offering different types of components but later we decided to focus more on components related to file formats (like xls, xlsx, doc, docx, pdf etc.) and grow in that area.

Now, aspose.com is the market leader offering [20+ file format APIs](https://products.aspose.com) for different platforms including .NET, Java, C++ and Android, reporting solutions for Microsoft SharePoint and rendering extensions for Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services and JasperReports with over [21,000 customers](https://websites.aspose.com/) (including **80% of Fortune 100 companies**) in 135 countries.

#### Our mission

Our mission is to help businesses save their costs and development efforts by offering the most complete and powerful set of file format APIs on the market so that developers don't have to spend more time in programming complex file formats but on building solutions for their customers.

Using our APIs, developers can create, convert and manipulate 100+ file formats on different platforms with few lines of code.

We support some of the most popular file formats in business, including Microsoft Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, Outlook emails and archives, Visio diagrams, Project files, OneNote documents, and Adobe Acrobat PDF documents. We also offer OCR, OMR, barcode generation and recognition, and image manipulation APIs.

#### Our websites

aspose.com is not the only website owned by Aspose Pty Ltd. We have several niche offerings in the file formats market under different brands. Feel free to [check our websites](https://websites.aspose.com/) for more details.
